sico is a simple interpreter for the SIC (Single Instruction Computer)
architecture. SIC was designed to determine what was the minimal 
number of instructions necessary to create any program. It turns out
that only one instruction (SBN) is needed.

SIC is a theoric architecture that is not meant to be used in the
real word for obvious performance reasons. I coded this interpreter
to practice writing a disassembler and writing the interpreter wouldn't
take much more time so I coded it also.

The SICemu class does all the heavy lifting. To run a program, simply
call sico with a .sic file as parameter.
