# Phone Number

Write a program that cleans up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.

The rules are as follows:

- If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad
  number
- If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1
  and use the last 10 digits
- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then
  it is a bad number
- If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad
  number

We've provided tests, now make them pass.

Hint: Only make one test pass at a time. Disable the others, then flip
each on in turn after you get the current failing one to pass.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the [getting started with C++](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-cpp.html)
page on the [exercism help site](http://help.exercism.io/).  This covers
the basic information on setting up the development environment expected
by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).
Create just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,
etc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write
just enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```C++
#if defined(EXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard C++11 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [CppReference](http://en.cppreference.com/)
is a wiki reference to the C++ language and standard library.  If you
are new to C++, but have programmed in C, beware of
[C traps and pitfalls](http://www.slideshare.net/LegalizeAdulthood/c-traps-and-pitfalls-for-c-programmers).
